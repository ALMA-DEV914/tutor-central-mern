# Interactive MERN Stack-TUTOR CENTRAL

## Description

This project test our collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app. It is an app that connects tutors and students.

## Concept

A marketplace for tutors and students to connect
Sometimes you just need an hour of support with a trusted tutor to solve a challenge. Our marketplace allows you to make that connection quickly and easily
As a Student I want to be able to search for Tutors that are experts in the subject for which I need help and coordinate time with them to resolve my question for a reasonable fee
As a Tutor I want to be able to present my skills and past tutoring in an attractive marketplace where Students can find me and connect easily so that I can provide support to them

## Requirements

    Use React for the front end.
    Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
    Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
    Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
    Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
    Have a polished UI.
    Be responsive.
    Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
    Include authentication (JWT).
    Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
    Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions,     indentation, quality comments, etc.).
    Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
